            Hola! I'm a guitarist, composer and producer. I create music, film
            and art projects in which I seek to combine my background in
            flamenco guitar with a wide variety of other genres, including
            Hip-Hop, Electronic and Latin-American music. In addition, I compose
            and produce music for short films and documentaries.
